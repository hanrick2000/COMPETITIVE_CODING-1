Permutations
A permutation of a finite set S is an ordered sequence of all elements in S, with each element appearing exactly 
once.

A k-permutation of S is an ordered sequence of k elements of S, with no element appearing more than
once in the sequence.

Thus, an ordinary permuations is an n-permutation of an n-set.

n!/(n-k)!

Cominations

A k-combination of an n-set S is simply a k-subset of S.
n!/(n-k)!k!
